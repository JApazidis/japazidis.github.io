<h3>My Background</h3>
    I have taken several classes here at Wood college the past two years.<p>These include Introduction to Programming, Database Management, Project Management, and Systems Architecture.<p> I have maintained my own web page promoting my music using Wordpress. 


<h3>My Interest in Web Development</h3>
        I have always been interested in creating different types of web pages, but I have only used WYSIWYG software (Wordpress, FrontPage).<p> I would like to expand my knowledge and create web pages from scratch. 


<h3>My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports or Hobbies</h3>
Being a professional folk musician, I have always wanted to promote this kind of music with my own web presence.<p> I would like to take it a step further with the knowledge gained from this class. 


<h3>What I Hope to Gain from This Course</h3>
        I would like the knowledge to begin to create my own webpages, or to be able to use these tools (HTML, Javascript, CSS) to improve my current pages.<p> I am also looking forward to returning to the traditional class environment and interacting with my professor and classmates. <br>Remote learning has its advantages but it does not take the place of a traditional classroom setting. 

<h3>Future Interests</h3>
<ul>
	<li>HTML5</li>
	<li>Wordpress</li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	<li>SQL</li>
