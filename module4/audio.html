<h4>One of my favorite movie stars, Tom Hanks, will release a new movie called “Finch” exclusively on Apple TV+ on November 5, 2021. <p> 
Here is what rollingstone.com has to say about the new up and coming movie:
“Tom Hanks, a dog and a robot venture through a post-apocalyptic wasteland in the new trailer for Finch.
In the film, Hanks plays Finch, a robotics engineer and one of the few survivors of a catastrophic solar event that’s turned the world into a scorched wilderness. <p>
Holed up in an underground bunker for a decade, Finch has crafted a decent life for himself and his canine companion, Goodyear, although he’s also been building a robot named Jeff, <p>
whom he hopes will look after Goodyear when he’s gone.
With a dangerous storm bearing down on them, Finch decides the trio must leave the bunker and head west.” <p>
I can’t wait to see the movie! </h4>
