</center>

<p><h3>The life of a great Greek</h3>


On July 29, 1925, Mikis Theodorakis was born in Chios, a Greek composer, lyricist, conductor, and politician. His origin is from Asia Minor, and his ancestors fought for the liberation of Greece from the Ottomans in 1821. Μikis considered one of the most important contemporary Greek composers and politicians. As a politician, he was a minister and four times elected member of the Greek Parliament with the Communist Party of Greece and New Democracy. At the same time, he was an activist honored with the Lenin Peace Prize in 1983. Due to his father's state work, Mikis Theodorakis lived as a child in various cities of the Greek province such as Chios, Mytilene, Ioannina, Argostoli, Pyrgos Ilias, Patras, and mainly in Tripoli, Arcadia. Growing up with Greek folk music and influenced by Byzantine music from his childhood, Mikis had already expressed his desire to become a composer. <br>
In 1937-1939, he started violin lessons at the Conservatory of Patra, which helped him create his first songs, compositions based on the poets Solomos, Palamas, Drosini, and Valaoritis, which he found in school books and the library of his home. His first musical listenings were the chants of the Orthodox Church, in which he took part as a chanter, but at the same time, he is participating in the championship as an athlete of the Patras Nautical Club. <br>
Before World War II, at the age of 17, he wrote his first compositions, and in 1942 he published his first poems under the pseudonym Dinos Mays. In 1943 he went to live permanently in the capital of the country, Athens, and with his teacher Phikloktitis Economidis, he continued his musical studies. At the same time, he acquires a political action that will cause him to be imprisoned and get to know Marx's work through the prison bars.<br>
He lived and died as he wished; a life full of music, fights, friends, and sworn enemies. Until the end of his life, he was an active citizen, a generator of music; he was the face - inspiration for all Greeks and not only. He lived a cinematic life, beatings, diseases, persecutions, exiles, struggles against injustice, and fascism of all kinds. Even if you disagreed with him on political views, what prevailed was that Mikis was the living political, social, and musical history of our country until today.

<h3>Resistance Action</h3>
In Tripoli, just 17 years old, he gives his first concert presenting the work of Cassianis and takes part in the resistance against the conquerors. In the great demonstration of March 25, 1943, he was arrested for the first time by the Italians and tortured. He escaped to Athens, where he organized in the Hellenic People's Liberation Army and performed enlightening duties in the Fifth Sector of the United Panhellenic Youth Organization. Ηe also fought as a member of the Silk Squadron of the 1st Battalion of Nea Smyrni during Dekemvriana (The Dekemvriana refers to a series of clashes fought during World War II in Athens from December 3, 1944, to January 11, 1945). At the same time, he is studying at the Athens Conservatory with professor Philoktitis Economidis.

<p>
<h3>Civil War</h3>
After December, he lives illegally in Athens where he is wanted by the police. He was arrested during the mass arrests on July 9, 1947, and then sent into exile with relative freedom of movement to Ikaria, where he is the party leader of the village of exile, from where he will try unsuccessfully to escape with the other exiles under Vassilis Zannos. With the general amnesty given by the government of Themistoklis Sofoulis, he acts illegally and tries to participate in the armed groups of the Democratic Army of Athens in the group of Pavlos Papamerkouriou.<br>
He is arrested again at his father's house where he found refuge while he was sick with pleurisy. He was then sent back to exile in Ikaria, but this time in disciplined living conditions for a few months. There he wrote the work "Elegy and mourning for Vassilis Zannos" dedicated to the memory of Vassilis Zannos who was executed in 1948. Then he was sent to the camp of Makronissos where he was tortured to paralysis. After the intervention of his father and uncle who are senior civil servants, he is released as a disabled person.

<h3>Studies in Paris</h3>
At the end of 1949, he returned to Chania, Crete, where he recovered. In 1950, however, he went back to Athens, from where he graduated from the Conservatory with a degree in harmony. He then served the rest of his term in Alexandroupolis, Athens, and Chania. In 1950 Mikis tried to commit suicide due to the constant challenges he faced as a communist, but he escaped the danger, and in 1951 he was finally dismissed from the army. In 1953 he married the doctor Myrto Altinoglou, with whom he had two children, George and Margarita. In 1954 he immigrated with a state scholarship to Paris. He enrolled at the Conservatoire and studied with Olivier Messian, music analysis and conducting an orchestra with Ezen Bigot for a short time. He composes music for the ballet of Ludmila Cherina, the Covent Garden, the Stuttgart Ballet, and also for the cinema. In 1957 he was awarded the first prize of the Moscow Festival by Shostakovich for his work on Suite No. 1 for piano and orchestra. At the same time, he composes many symphonic and chamber music pieces.
<p>
<h3>Back to Greece</h3>
In 1960 he returned to Greece. In September of the same year, the Epitaph is recorded for the first time, opening a new Greek song path. Epitaph marks a fundamental change in the musical form because it marries contemporary folk music with modern Greek poetry and European art with the Greek folk element. The first version of the Epitaph of Giannis Ritsos (written in 1958) was recorded by Nana Mouskouri, orchestrated, and conducted by Manos Hadjidakis. In the same year, Mikis Theodorakis begins and almost ends the Axion Esti of Odysseas Elytis. However, I did not rush to present it, as he says in his book "Music for the Masses", because I felt that the Greek public was not mature enough to accept it. His first execution took place at the end of 1964 ″. In 1960, also, Mikis Theodorakis wrote the music for Epiphania, in poetry by George Seferis, and composed dozens of cycles of songs that find profound repercussions in Greece. He founded the Athens Small Symphony Orchestra and gave many concerts to try to acquaint the world with symphonic music. In 1963, after the assassination of Grigoris Lambrakis, the "Lambrakis Youth" was founded, of which he was elected President. At the same time, he got elected member of the United Democratic Left, and in 1964 he gained international recognition with the composition of the music for the film by Michalis Kakogiannis, Alexis Zorbas (Zorba the Greek).
</p>
<h3>Years of Dictatorship</h3>
On April 21, 1967, he went underground and made the first appeal for resistance against the Dictatorship on April 23. Then, in May 1967, together with others, he founded the first resistance organization against the Dictatorship, the PAM, and was elected its president.<br>
He was arrested in August 1967. He was imprisoned on Bouboulinas Street, isolated, Averoff Prison, went on a hunger strike, was hospitalized, released from prison, and placed under house arrest. Nevertheless, he transfers many of his new works abroad in various ways, where Maria Farantouri and Melina Mercouri sing them.<br>
A storm of protests is raging abroad. Celebrities such as Dmitry Shostakovich, Arthur Miller, Lawrence Olivier, Yves Montand, and others set up commissions for his release. Eventually, he was released from prison under this pressure and traveled to Paris in April 1970. Abroad, he addressed a new call for the fall of the Dictatorship and the return of the Republic to Greece.<br>
In 1972 he visited Israel to give concerts and met with Yasser Arafat, to whom he delivered the message of the Israeli government and tried to persuade him to start talks with the other side.<br>

<h3>Political Changeover</h3>
In 1974, with the fall of the Dictatorship, he returned to Greece. He gives many concerts both at home and abroad together with Maria Farantouri. Also, he participates in the public either as an ordinary citizen, or as a Member of Parliament ( 1981-86 and 1989-92), or as Minister of State (1990-92), positions from which he eventually resigns. In 1976 he founded the "Culture of Peace" Movement and gave lectures and concerts throughout Greece. In 1983 he was awarded the Lenin Prize for Peace. In 1986, Greek-Turkish friendship committees were created in Greece with Miki as president and in Turkey with well-known intellectuals such as Aziz Nesin, Yasar Kemal, and Zulfu Livaneli.

<h3>The Support of Human Rights</h3>
In 1990 he gave 36 concerts all over Europe under the auspices of Amnesty International, for solar energy (under the aegis of Eurosolar), against illiteracy, against drugs. He also fights for human rights in other countries, especially in neighboring Albania (which he also visits as Minister for the rights of the Greek minority) and Turkey. He proposes the organization of a Pan-European Peace Conference in Delphi and submits a plan for an "Olympics of the Spirit" to the government. In 1993 he took over as General Manager of ERT Music Ensembles but resigned the following year. In 1994 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Quebec. In 1994, the signing of the agreement between Israelis and Palestinians in Oslo had performed by Maria Farantouri -  become the national anthem of Israel - and the Hymn to Palestine. Theodorakis, in recognition of his contribution to the cause of Peace in this region. In the following years, the operas of Electra (1995) and Antigone (1999) had presented. Theodorakis developed a remarkable activity abroad and took a dynamic position in all the critical events (Greek-Turkish friendship, earthquakes, bombings in Yugoslavia, Ocalan's case, the war in Afghanistan, and Iraq). In 2002 the opera of Lysistrata had presented a true hymn to Peace. Also Theodorakis gives many concerts in Turkey, attended mainly by young people with slogans in favor of friendship between the two peoples. Later he plays the role of the informal ambassador of peace again, conveying messages of the Greek prime ministers, Andreas Papandreou and Konstantinos Mitsotakis, to the Turkish. 

<h3>Political Activity</h3>

However, he received 6,345 preference crosses and placed third among eight candidates. The combination won a seat. In 1978, after a proposal he accepted, he decided to run for mayor of Athens, supported by the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) but failed to get elected. In 1981 he managed to get elected Member of Parliament  with the ballot of the Communist Party of Greece, and he was re-elected in 1985. In 1990, with the split of the KKE and due to his disagreement with this situation, he decided to step down as an independent collaborator with Nea Dimokratia. On December 1, 2010, Mikis Theodorakis announced the establishment of an Independent Citizens Movement called "Spitha," intending to involve every independent citizen to get the country out of the deep crisis. On September 19, 2013, he announced his "retirement" from the country's political life, without however stopping the interventions until the end.  In May 2017, together with other people with the same spirit, he called on the people to come down to the Constitution to protest "against the coup d'etat and catastrophic 4th memorandum".
