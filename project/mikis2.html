<h1>Mikis The Great: Dedicated to  Mikis Theodorakis</h1>

<h3>The most famous dance: Sirtaki</h3>
Syrtaki is one of the most famous Greek dances, choreographed by George Provias in 1964 for the film Zorbas the Greek. The film Alexis Zorbas (Zorba the Greek) is a British-Greek film of 1964, directed by Michalis Kakogiannis with Anthony Quinn, Alan Bates, Irini Pappas, and Sotiris Moustakas and is all about the book by Nikos Kazantzakis, Life and State of Alexis Zorbas. The film won three Academy Awards in 1964, most notably the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for Lila Centrova as Madame Ordens. In addition, the music of the film, written by Mikis Theodorakis, became world-famous as Zorba's Sirtaki. The name sirtaki comes from syrtos, a common name for a group of traditional Greek dances in which dancers "drag" their feet.<br>
